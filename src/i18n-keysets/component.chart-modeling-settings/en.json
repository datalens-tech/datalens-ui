  "tooltip_trend-method": "**Linear**: A linear regression, a straight line, helps to generally assess growth or decline in a selected interval.\n**Quadratic**: Use if the source data clearly shows a nonlinear dependence in the data.\n**Cubic**: Use if more than one inflection is clearly visible in the source data.\n\nWhen making decisions, use the quadratic and cubic functions carefully. Follow the recommendations above."
